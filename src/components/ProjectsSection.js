          <h3>Analyzing the Housing Crisis in California</h3>
          <p className="date">May 2023 | Tableau</p>
          <p>
            Conducted comprehensive analysis on housing affordability in
            California by utilizing five data sets and visualizing the data
            using Tableau. Investigated trends and patterns in housing prices,
            income levels, and tax rates to analyze factors contributing to the
            housing crisis and assess the impact of rising housing costs on
            todayâ€™s population compared to 50+ years ago. Collaborated with a
            team to unveil significant housing affordability challenges: Average
            house prices increased by over 1,150% while income rose by only 373%
            over the past few decades, resulting in houses being 7.5 times the
            median salary and extended saving time for down payments.
